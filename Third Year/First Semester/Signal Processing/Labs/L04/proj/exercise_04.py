        Exercise 04:

    The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory states that a sufficient sample rate 
for a signal with maximum frequency B is at least 2B. In our case the maximum
frequency our signal has is 200, thus the result would be: 2 * 200 = 400.
    Since the theorem says it should be "at least" 2B then we should add 1 to the result.
    Final Answer: 2 * 200 + 1 = 401Hz
